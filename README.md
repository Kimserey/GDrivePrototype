Google Drive access using Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.GooglePlayService.Drive component

Before starting, make sure that you have performed the following steps:

 1. Enable Google Drive on the Google API developer console.
 2. Create credentials using the package name and SHA-1 signature
         - For debug, the SHA-1 must be taken from the debug keystore used by Xamarin to sign the app
         - For release, the SHA-1 must be taken from the keystore used to sign the app
